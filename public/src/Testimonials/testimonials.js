            "The Waterfront is a welcome addition for fishkeepers. Louis is very knowledgeable and approachable.\n\nThe thing I like the best about The Waterfront is that Louis is what I call \"The Fish Detective.\" He has been able to track down hard to find plecos for me, quarantine them in his store, make sure they are eating, etc.\n\nI will definitely be a repeat customer.","Doug Jessop"
