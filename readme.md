### Getting Started

Clone this code

Run `npm install` This will also install subprojects

Run `npm start` This should start subprojects if they are needed

### Project structure

This has sub projects one for public one for server and we will add more if needed in the future. Each sub-project will have details in those folders

[public readme](./public/readme.md) and [server readme](./server/readme.md) 

each of these should have `npm start` for local development and any scrips related to development / build / deploy running in production should be in the package.json scripts section
